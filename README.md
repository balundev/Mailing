# Mailing
HTML mailing exercise
Exercise made for mailing after joining newsletter or creating account on website, used table,td,tr because emails are not adapted to other HTML formats. 

To check this u need to copy HTML body section to "send-script.php" file, and write new HTML with inputs and submit button, to enter your name and email adress. 

I only made a template how should be created HTML for emails.
